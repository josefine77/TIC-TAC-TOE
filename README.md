# TIC-TAC-TOE
A console-based tic-tac-toe game made with python.
The goal was to make a tic-tac-toe game using a class system.

how to play:
- decide whether you or the computer should take the first turn by typing "1" or "2" and pressing enter
- then write your chosen field in the format "B3" for example

What I have learned:
- using attributes for objects
- organizing the script in classes
-  (a list system turned out more effective)
